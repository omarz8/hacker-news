# Hacker-news
Thank you for watching my repository! 

This is an App to practice and learn GraphQL. Tecnologies: GraphQL, React, Prisma, Postgresql, Apollo.

## Summary

In this project, I covered how to build a fully-featured Hackernews with React and Apollo Client.

I implemented several features such as displaying a list of links, signup and authentication, creating new links, voting on links, and pagination. I also built in realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions. 

The backend was powered by apollo-server. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for GraphQL Playground and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.
The stack I used was based on Node.js, apollo-server and Prisma.

The resolvers for GraphQL server use Prisma for database access.
